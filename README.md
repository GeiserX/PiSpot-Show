# PiSpot Show

[![pispot-show compliant](https://img.shields.io/github/license/GeiserX/PiSpot-Show)](https://github.com/GeiserX/PiSpot-Show/blob/main/LICENSE)

HDMI-Connected IoT device based on Raspberry Pi with PiJuice to provide Wi-Fi voucher codes in Hotels. Previously known as PiSpot HDMI. Developed and deployed in 2018 for the company GPConnect. I have decided to release the project as open-source due to the client's inability to proceed with payment.
